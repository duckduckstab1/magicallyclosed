###### A plan to cure BonziWORLD from skids and spammers!

<hr>


> Step One:
`For bots that u actually want to exist (such as cosmicbot and bonzibot) check for their connecting ip address, channel and name. if all are correct then let it through if even one is incorrect then the connection gets terminated`


> Step Two:
`Add a chat cooldown (configurable) to prevent spam`


> Step Three:
`For god sake filter the word "behh"`


> Step Four:
`Check if the same ip is accessing the site on a different browser window/tab and disconnect it from the server`


> Step Five:
`(theoretical territory!) look for user input in the js terminal and ban the user`

> Step Six:
`Make users complete a recaptcha challenge before logging in to a room`


> Step Seven:
`Add a whitelist for /godmode. Even if they have the godword, their ip would be still be required for the command to go through. (if ur not on the list than too bad ðŸ˜¢)`


> Step Eight:
`Recruit more staff to moderate bwr`


> Step Nine:
`Implement a process for reporting nasty troublemakers so staff can be notified of their misdeeds across bwr and take more effective action against them`
