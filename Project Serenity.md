###### A plan to cure BonziWORLD from skids and spammers!

<hr>


> Step One:
<br>
`For bots that u actually want to exist (such as cosmicbot and bonzibot) check for their connecting ip address, channel and name. if all are correct then let it through. NOTE: if even one part of the response is incorrect then the connection gets terminated!`


> Step Two:
<br>
`Add a chat cooldown (configurable) to prevent spam`


> Step Three:
<br>
`For god sake filter the word "behh"`


> Step Four:
<br>
`Check if the same ip is accessing the site on a different browser window/tab and disconnect it from the server`


> Step Five:
<br>
`(theoretical territory!) look for user input in the js terminal and ban the user`

> Step Six:
<br>
`Make users complete a recaptcha challenge before logging in to a room`


> Step Seven:
<br>
`Add a whitelist for /godmode. Even if they have the godword, their ip would be still be required for the command to go through. (if ur not on the list than too bad ðŸ˜¢)`


> Step Eight:
<br>
`Recruit more staff to moderate bwr`


> Step Nine:
<br>
`Implement a process for reporting nasty troublemakers so staff can be notified of their misdeeds across bwr and take more effective action against them`


> Step Ten:
<br>
`Encrypt script.min.js`
