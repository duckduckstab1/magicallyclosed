# BonziWORLD Revived+

This project is serious development. Things could change drastically throughout it's evolution.
<br>
Here be dragons!

All the source code for the server and client is publically available here. If you want to run your own BonziWORLD, by all means go ahead. Do whatever you'd like with this code. Just try to put me somewhere in the credits.

### Running BWR+
```
cd server
npm install
node index.js
```
After this, BonziWORLD Revived+ will be accessible on port 3000. (http://localhost:3000/)
